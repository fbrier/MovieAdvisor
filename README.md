# MovieAdvisor
This is a small bit of code to share with our [Python meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Minden-Python-Meetup/). Jim,
our fearless leader suggested we play with one of the web/html page scrapers. These are a couple of simple classes that
extract data from our local theater and then uses TTS to tell you what movies are playing.
